"Failed to connect to ESP32: Timed out waiting for packet header" (The Biggest Issue For Me)

A: If you are using jumper wires, I HIGHLY reccommend you switch to an ESP32-CAM-MB USB Programmer. 
This ensures that you have a enough power to enable the wifi capabilities. Also, the instructions are for the USB programmer. 

A: If you are using a programmer, when you start to see these dots on the debugging window when uploading a new scheme, press and 
hold the ESP32-CAM on-board RST button until you see "connecting". This should put your board in "flash mode" which allows the code
to upload.




"No IP Address is showing in the Serial Monitor or dots are just showing"

A: Make sure you have the right wifi information inputed. If you have no password just leave the "password" field as "". 
   Also, it's case sensitive make sure the name and password EXACTLY match your wifi information.





Disclosure: The next steps will be for companies or if you're on an open/secure network

The ESP32 CAM does NOT have a visible MAC address to bypass open wifi security protocols. This will result in a "blank" page when you enter the unique IP adress in 
your webserver. 

To solve this issue:

Go to the main page and select the "MAC" code. Run this code in Arduino, click Tools, Serial Monitor, and the MAC address should be visible.
Go to your wifi settings and add the MAC address to the "allowed devices" section





"COM Port not found/not available" (One of my biggest issues)

A: Make sure you have have a "data transfer" capable USB cord. Phone USB chargers WILL NOT WORK.
